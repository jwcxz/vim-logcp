logcp syntax
============

JWC :: jwcxz.com


[logcp] is a tiny shell script that mass-copies files or directories from some
directory to another with user interaction to define the destinations.  It also
saves the list of copied objects to a log.

This bundle contains a syntax highlighting definition for the mapping file, as
shown in the screenshot.
